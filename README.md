#Eyetrack
EyeTrack is an R-based toolbox intended to facilitate research analysis of eyetracking data (see [How it works](#how-it-works)). It has been programmed in a modular and scalable fashion to open collaborative work between researchers interested in implementing different algorithms for saccade, blink and fixation detection while respecting a main architecture (see [Pipeline architecture](#pipeline-architecture)).
